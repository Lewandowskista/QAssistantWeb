## What is QAssistant?

QAssistant is an always-on-top floating desktop widget designed for QA engineers who juggle multiple projects, tools, and tasks at once. It keeps everything you need — your Linear issues, notes, links, files, and Kanban board — in one lightweight, pinnable window that stays out of your way until you need it.
